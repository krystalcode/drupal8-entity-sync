# Synchronization providers make available the clients that communicate with the

# providers can be defined in a module or application in order to allow
# synchronization with multiple remote resources.

# Example provider for synchronizing with a remote ERP system:
# entity_sync.provider.erp:
#   id: erp

#     - import
#     - import_list

# Synchronization operations are the operations supported by the Entity Sync
# module. Providers should list the operations they support, and
# synchronizations should list the operations to enable so that Entity Sync
# can automatically perform related tasks.
#
# Currently supported operations are:
# import: Import an individual entity from the remote resource.
# import_list: Import a list of entities from the remote resource.
# export: Export an individual entity to the remote resource.
#
# Example operations section in a synchronization:
# entity_sync.sync.user:
#   id: user
#   operations:
#     - id: import_list
#       status: true
